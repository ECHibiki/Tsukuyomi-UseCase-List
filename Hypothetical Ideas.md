# List of Hypothetical Ideas Which could be Added
- Reintroduce the blotter into both UI
- /trans/ should show polls or scores
- .GIF timestamps
- Spoilers on embeds
- redis query caching instead of board tables
- Give a rank based voting for polls
- Thumbnail and media editor should be through an interface which allows swapping out for something other than imagemagik
- Exif stripping should be a bit more advanced(whatever that means)
- On the mod UI, a place for uploads to the statics directory
